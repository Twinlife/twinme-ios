        Our mission is to ensure the confidentiality of your privacy<br/>
        SKRED is exclusively governed by French law
    </p>
    <p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
    <p>SKRED, in accordance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) , ensures the user that his data and identity will remain confidential to other users.</p>
    <p><strong>Guarantees</strong></p>
    <p>As a service and hosting technical platform provider, SKRED does not edit the content exchanged by the user, who remains the exclusive owner and manager of his own SKRED publications, unlike the practice of many other apps or website editors. SKRED is committed to protecting the confidentiality of your personal data, which may be collected during the use of the service. All provided or collected information during the use of SKRED, or the website https://www.skred.mobi, is strictly confidential. When you download the SKRED application, no personally identifiable information will be requested to access the service. If you wish to create a SKRED account, simply create an anonymous user name and we will never know who you are. Your contact details will never be disclosed or leased to third parties.</p>
    <p><strong>Data Collection</strong></p>
    <p>SKRED automatically collects a minimum set of data when you are using the service. The collected data concerns:</p>
    <p>Device</p>
    <p>SKRED collects information about the type of device you are using to access the service, including the model, operating system and its version, the device unique identifier, and information on the mobile network. These data are not stored and are used only to enhance your experience by offering you an optimised service (audio/video quality, sizes of images, widths of screens…).</p>
    <p>Location</p>
    <p>If you grant access to your location information, SKRED will use your geolocation information in order to offer you a personalized experience taking into account, for instance, your language preferences.</p>
    <p>Logs</p>
    <p>SKRED saves information about your usage of the service, what type of browser you are using, the time stamp, your IP address, and the ID of the service used. These data are not stored permanently and are strictly necessary for the smooth operation of the service.</p>
    <p><strong>For how long is the data stored?</strong></p>
    <p>SKRED will store your data only for the time necessary, and proportional to the aim for which it was stored.</p>
    <p><strong>What are your rights?</strong></p>
    <p>According to the French Act n°78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Information Technology, Data files and Civil Liberties (“loi informatique et liberté”), you have a right to access, to question and to rectify your personal information.</p>
    <p>In addition, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data on legitimate grounds, and the right to object to the use of your personal data for advertising purposes, including marketing purposes.</p>
    <p>You also have the right to request to rectify, complete, update, block or delete the personal data that are inaccurate, incomplete, equivocal, expired, or whose collection, usage, disclosure or retention is prohibited.</p>
    <p>You can exercise your rights by contacting: SKRED by mail at the following address SKRED, 37 bis, rue Grenata, 75002 PARIS, FRANCE, with a signed copy of proof of identity.</p>
    <p>According to the French Act n°78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Information Technology, Data files and Civil Liberties (“loi informatique et liberté”), you have the right to access and rectify your personal data by sending an email to SKRED at: dpo@skred.mobi.</p>
    <p>To ensure confidentiality and the protection of your personal data, SKRED must verify the identity of the user before answering the request. Thus, a signed copy of proof of identity must be attached to any request relating to exercise your rights.</p>
    <p><strong>Legal requests</strong></p>
    <p>SKRED head office is in France and the application shall only be governed by the law of that country. Any demand or request from a Government (including from the United States and Russia) regarding data transmission will be examined thoroughly. The only valid reason compelling us to transmit confidential data would result from a court decision, a judicial request or mandate, enquiring us to transmit elements we would have.</p>
    <p><strong>Safety</strong></p>
    <p>SKRED applies enhanced security standards to protect your personal data. Your personal data is stored behind proxies, and the transactions between your device and our servers are secured by SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). Only authorised staff has access to the data collected automatically, and this staff shall treat your information as sensitive and confidential. SKRED data is stored on servers in Europe and under French law, and all the more so, under European law. For this purpose, SKRED files have been declared to the CNIL (“Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés”, the French Data Protection Authority), and are in conformity with the provisions of the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR).</p>
    <p><strong>Privacy Policy update</strong></p>
    <p>The Privacy Policy has been updated October 15, 2018. This Privacy Policy may be subjected to change or amended at any time by SKRED.</p>
    <p>Please consult this document periodically.</p>
