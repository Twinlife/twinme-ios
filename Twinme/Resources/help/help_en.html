<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>After entering your default “<strong>Profile</strong>” (name and image)
  used to “<strong>invite</strong>” your <em>twinme</em> <strong>contacts</strong>, you need to
  <strong>create your <em>twinme</em> contact list</strong>. Indeed, <em>twinme</em> does not use phone numbers or
  any other personal information that can identify you or your contacts. <em>twinme</em> does not peek
  into your address book, which contains personal information about your contacts that <em>twinme</em>
  could not use.</p>

<p>– Tap the “<strong>Add a new contact</strong>” icon, and then choose how
  you want to share your “<strong><i>invitation twincode</i></strong>”: “<strong>In-person</strong>”
  if the person is near you physically, or with a “<strong>Social</strong>” application, such as Message,
  Mail, or a social network otherwise.</p>

<p>– When <strong>receiving</strong> a <em>twinme invitation twincode</em>,
  from <b>scanning</b> its “<strong>QR-Code</strong>” with <em>twinme</em>, or from <strong>opening</strong>
  with <em>twinme</em> <strong>the web address</strong> received by email, text, chat, SMS or any other
  means, you can “<strong>Accept</strong>” or “<b>Reject</b>” the invitation. You will be able to
  <strong>Edit </strong> later the specific profile (name and image) you want to share with this particular
  contact (see below).</p>

<p>At the end of this process, you and your contact share a unique
  <b><i>relation</i></b>, which cannot be used by anyone else, and are under full control of each end.</p>

<h2>Contacts</h2>

<p>Tap a contact entry in your <em>twinme</em> contact list to:</p>

<p>– “<strong>Select</strong>” the type of communication you want
  to use: <strong>chat</strong> messages, <strong>voice</strong> call or <strong>video</strong> call;</p>

<p>– “<strong>Edit</strong>” your name and image representing
  you to each particular contact;</p>

<p>– “<strong>Edit</strong>” your contact local name.</p>

<p>When you change your image, the new one is pushed to your contact’s
  device and appears in his/her contact list.</p>

<p>If you <b>change your name</b>, the new one is pushed to your contact’s device
  and appears as your default local name when your contact wants to edit it.</p>

<p>When you “<strong>Remove a Contact</strong>”, you appear as <b>anonymous</b>
  in his/her contact list, and you cannot communicate with each other’s anymore.</p>
